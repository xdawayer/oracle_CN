## Introduction: The Mirror of Relationship

### The Death of "Compatibility"
Before Liz Greene published *Relating* in 1977, relationship astrology was often reduced to a simplistic game of "synastry scoring." Books would say things like, "Aries gets along with Leo, but fights with Cancer." Greene demolished this superficial approach. She argued that **compatibility is a myth**.

Why? Because we do not choose partners based on who we "get along with." We choose partners based on who can handle our **projections**. We unconsciously select individuals who carry the missing pieces of our own psyche—our Shadow, our Anima/Animus, our unlived potential.

### The Thesis: Relationship as a Path to Wholeness
Greene posits that relationship is the most accurate mirror of the Self.
* **The Projection Mechanism**: Whatever is unconscious in us is experienced as "Fate" or "Other."
 * If I repress my anger (Mars), I will inevitably attract an angry partner. I will say, "Why do I always meet such aggressive people?" The answer is: Because I need them to act out my Mars for me.
* **The Goal**: The goal of *Relating* is not to find the "perfect match," but to use the friction of relationship to withdraw projections and become a whole individual. Only two whole individuals can have a real relationship; otherwise, it is just two neuroses interacting.

### Who Is This Book For?
* **The Serial Monogamist**: Who keeps dating the "same person with a different face" and wants to break the pattern.
* **The Couple in Crisis**: Who feels "stuck" in a dynamic they cannot understand.
* **The Jungian Student**: Who wants to see how abstract concepts like Anima and Shadow manifest in the gritty reality of marriage and divorce.

## Part I: The Individual Psyche — The Prerequisite for Relating

You cannot relate to another until you relate to yourself. Greene spends the first third of the book dismantling the structure of the individual personality.

### 1. The Structure of the Unconscious
Drawing on Jung, Greene maps the psyche:
* **The Ego**: The conscious "I" (Sun).
* **The Persona**: The mask we wear for society (Ascendant).
* **The Shadow**: The rejected, "inferior" traits we hide (Saturn/Mars/Pluto).
* **The Anima/Animus**: The contrasexual soul-image (Moon/Venus for men, Sun/Mars for women).

**The Rule**: In any relationship, it is not just Ego meeting Ego. It is Ego+Shadow+Anima meeting Ego+Shadow+Animus. It is a crowded room.

### 2. The Elements in Relationship: The War of Types
Greene uses the four elements (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) to explain the fundamental misunderstandings between people.

* **Fire vs. Earth (Intuition vs. Sensation)**
 * *The Conflict*: The Fire type lives in the future ("possibilities"). The Earth type lives in the present ("facts").
 * *The Drama*: Fire calls Earth "boring, slow, stuck in the mud." Earth calls Fire "irresponsible, dreamy, impractical."
 * *The Attraction*: Fire needs Earth to ground its visions. Earth needs Fire to inspire its labor. They need each other desperately, but they drive each other crazy.

* **Air vs. Water (Thinking vs. Feeling)**
 * *The Conflict*: The Air type values logic, objectivity, and distance. The Water type values emotion, subjectivity, and closeness.
 * *The Drama*: Air says, "Let's talk about this rationally." Water says, "You don't feel anything; you're cold." Air feels suffocated by Water's needs; Water feels abandoned by Air's detachment.
 * *The Attraction*: Air learns compassion from Water. Water learns perspective from Air.

* **Synthesis**: Greene advises that we often marry our "inferior function" (the missing element). A person with no Water (Thinking type) will marry a super-emotional Water type. Why? To import the missing function. The partner becomes the "carrier" of the emotion.

## Part II: The Shadow in Love — "Beauty and the Beast"

This chapter is legendary. Greene analyzes how we fall in love with our own darkness.

### 1. The Attraction to the Beast
* **The Scenario**: A "good girl" (socially adapted, polite, repressed) falls in love with a "bad boy" (wild, irresponsible, dangerous).
* **The Psychology**: She is not attracted to his "badness" per se. She is attracted to her own **repressed vitality**. Her own Mars/Pluto energy was forbidden in childhood ("Nice girls don't get angry"). So, she outsourced it. When she sees him acting out that energy, she feels a rush of excitement. She feels "complete" through him.

### 2. The Inevitable Crisis
* **The Turning Point**: Eventually, the trait she loved becomes the trait she hates.
 * "He was so spontaneous!" becomes "He is unreliable!"
 * "She was so emotional and deep!" becomes "She is a hysterical nag!"
* **The Reform Project**: She tries to change him. She tries to make the Beast into a Prince (i.e., make him "nice" like her).
* **The Irony**: If she succeeds—if he becomes safe and boring—she loses interest. The sexual spark dies because he no longer carries her Shadow projection.

### 3. The Solution: Owning the Shadow
To save the relationship, she must stop trying to fix him and start trying to **integrate her own badness**. She must learn to be assertive, angry, or wild herself. When she owns the energy, she no longer needs him to act it out for her. The relationship can then evolve from "projection" to "partnership."

## Part III: The Inner Partner — Anima and Animus

This is arguably the most technically complex and psychologically profound section of the book. Greene argues that we all carry an internal image of the "Ideal Mate," and we overlay this image onto the people we meet.

### 1. The Anima: The Inner Woman in a Man
* **Significators**: The **Moon** and **Venus** in a man's chart.
* **Definition**: The Anima is the man's bridge to his own soul (Eros). It represents his capacity for feeling, relating, and experiencing life as "meaningful."
* **The Projection**: A man does not see a woman; he sees his Anima projected onto her.
 * *Venus in Aries Anima*: He projects the image of the "Amazon Warrior." He wants a woman who is fierce, independent, and challenging. If he meets a gentle, domestic Cancerian type, he won't be "turned on," even if she is a lovely person. He needs the fire.
 * *Moon in Pisces Anima*: He projects the image of the "Mystical Mermaid" or "Suffering Victim." He wants to save her, or be saved by her. He is attracted to elusive, fragile women.
* **The Four Stages of the Anima (Evolution)**:
 1. **Eve**: The biological mother. The woman as a provider of food and sex.
 2. **Helen**: The romantic/sexual ideal. The woman as a prize to be won.
 3. **Mary**: The spiritual guide. The woman as a moral inspiration.
 4. **Sophia**: Wisdom. The woman as an equal partner in truth.
* **Anima Possession**: If a man ignores his inner feelings (represses the Anima), she takes over his personality. He becomes moody, irrational, hypersensitive, and sulky (negative Moon traits). He acts like a "bad woman" when he is stressed.

### 2. The Animus: The Inner Man in a Woman
* **Significators**: The **Sun** and **Mars** in a woman's chart.
* **Definition**: The Animus is the woman's bridge to the spirit (Logos). It represents her capacity for logic, structure, and focused will.
* **The Projection**: A woman projects her Animus onto a man.
 * *Mars in Capricorn Animus*: She projects the image of the "Authority Figure/CEO." She is attracted to power, status, and competence. She wants a man who can "handle things."
 * *Sun in Leo Animus*: She projects the image of the "King/Hero." She wants a man who shines, who is creative and central. She wants to be the Queen to his King.
* **The Four Stages of the Animus (Evolution)**:
 1. **Tarzan**: Physical power. The athlete/muscle man.
 2. **Romantic Hero**: The poet/artist/explorer. (Byron/Shelley).
 3. **Lloyd George**: The orator/professor/political leader. Intellectual power.
 4. **Hermes**: The spiritual guide. The psychopomp.
* **Animus Possession**: If a woman ignores her own need for power/thinking (represses the Animus), he takes over. She becomes opinionated, rigid, argumentative, and "always right" (negative Sun/Mars traits). She lectures people instead of relating to them.

### 3. The "Double Whammy" Interaction
Relationships usually begin when the projections match perfectly.
* **The Hook**: "My Anima looks like your Persona." AND "Your Animus looks like my Persona."
* **The Illusion**: We fall in love with the image. "You are exactly who I dreamed of!"
* **The Disillusionment**: This is the inevitable (and necessary) stage where the projection falls off.
 * He realizes she isn't a Goddess; she's a human with bad breath.
 * She realizes he isn't a Hero; he's a guy who leaves socks on the floor.
* **The Crossroads**: At this point, most couples break up (to find a new screen for the projection). But the mature soul stays and learns to love the *human* beneath the image.

## Part IV: Parental Complexes — Marrying the Family

Greene explores how the **Parental Marriage** (seen in the natal chart) becomes the unconscious blueprint for all future relationships.

### 1. The Sun-Moon Aspect: The Inner Marriage
Your natal Sun (Father) and Moon (Mother) aspect describes your "Internal Marriage."
* **Sun Conjunct Moon**:
 * *The Blueprint*: The parents were seen as a united front. The masculine and feminine energies are fused.
 * *The Result*: The person seeks a partner who is "just like me." They want total merging. They are often self-contained and stable, but may struggle to understand difference.
* **Sun Square Moon**:
 * *The Blueprint*: "The Civil War." The parents were at cross-purposes (e.g., Father wanted career, Mother wanted emotional closeness). The child felt torn: "If I please Dad, I betray Mum."
 * *The Result*: Inner conflict. They project this conflict onto relationships. They pick partners who fight them. They unconsciously believe that **"Love equals War."**
 * *The Gift*: If resolved, they have tremendous energy and can build a relationship that honors difference.
* **Sun Trine Moon**:
 * *The Blueprint*: "The Easy Harmony." The parents seemed to get along without effort.
 * *The Result*: They expect relationships to be easy.
 * *The Trap*: Complacency. When conflict arises, they give up easily. "It shouldn't be this hard." They lack the grit of the Square person.

### 2. The Oedipal Triangle
* **The Father's Daughter**: A woman with a strong Sun-Venus or Sun-Jupiter aspect may have been "Daddy's Princess." She idolizes her father.
 * *The Consequence*: No man can measure up to Dad. She picks men who are "safe" (inferior to Dad) so she never has to leave the psychological marriage with her father.
* **The Mother's Son**: A man with a strong Moon-Venus aspect may be "Mummy's Boy."
 * *The Consequence*: He looks for a mother-substitute to take care of him. Or he rebels against women because he fears being engulfed again (the Devouring Mother).

### 3. The Unlived Life of the Parent
Greene repeats her core teaching: **"The greatest burden on the child is the unlived life of the parent."**
* *Example*: A mother sacrifices her career for her children (repressed Ambition/Sun). The daughter picks up this "unlived Sun."
 * *Outcome*: The daughter becomes a workaholic CEO to "pay off" the mother's sacrifice. Or, she refuses to work at all, paralyzed by the mother's secret resentment of work.
* *The Solution*: We must separate our own destiny from our parents' regrets.

## Part V: Synastry — The Alchemy of Two Charts

Greene finally addresses the technical aspects of comparing two charts, but she focuses on the *meaning* rather than the *mechanics*.

### 1. The Role of Saturn: The Glue
Greene famously states that **"Saturn is the planet of enduring relationships."**
* **The Myth**: Pop astrology loves Jupiter (fun) and Venus (romance).
* **The Reality**: Relationships based only on Venus/Jupiter aspects are fun, but they don't last. They fall apart when the first crisis hits.
* **The Saturn Contract**: For a marriage or long-term bond to survive, there *must* be strong Saturn aspects between the charts (e.g., Partner A's Saturn conjunct Partner B's Moon).
 * *The Feeling*: "I owe you something." "I am responsible for you." It feels heavy, but it creates a container that holds the relationship together through the storms.
 * *The Caution*: If the Saturn person is unconscious, they can become the "Warden," restricting the other person's growth.

### 2. The Outer Planet Contacts: The Karmic Hook
When Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto touches a personal planet in synastry, the relationship is **transformational** (and usually uncontrollable).
* **Uranus Contacts**: "The Lightning Bolt." Sudden attraction, electric excitement.
 * *Outcome*: Often short-lived. Great for an affair or an awakening. Hard for stability. It breaks old patterns.
* **Neptune Contacts**: "The Soulmate." Telepathy, idealization, unconditional love.
 * *Outcome*: High risk of deception or disillusionment. One person plays the "Savior," the other the "Victim." The lesson is about spiritual love vs. human dependency.
* **Pluto Contacts**: "The Obsession." Intensity, power struggles, sexual compulsion. "I can't live without you."
 * *Outcome*: Death and Rebirth. The relationship burns away the ego. It forces deep psychological change. It is rarely "easy," but it is profound.

### 3. The Composite Chart: The Third Entity
Greene touches on the Composite Chart (the midpoint chart).
* **The Concept**: The relationship itself is a "living entity" with its own destiny.
* **The Interpretation**: Two people might have compatible natal charts (Synastry), but a terrible Composite Chart (e.g., Composite Saturn square Mars). This means they like each other, but the *relationship itself* encounters constant obstacles.
* **Fate**: The Composite Chart shows the "Purpose" of the union. A Composite Sun in the 11th House means the relationship exists to serve a friendship or a cause, not necessarily a domestic family life.

## ️ Part VI: Synthesis and Conclusion

### 1. The Aquarian Age of Relationship
Greene ends with a visionary look at the future.
* **The Shift**: We are moving from the Leo/Aquarius axis (Fixed roles, "My King/My Queen") to a more fluid, friendship-based model.
* **The Goal**: Relationships of **Voluntary Association**. We stay together not because of economic necessity (Earth) or social duty (Saturn), but because we choose to walk the path together.

### 2. The Final Verdict on Compatibility
* There is no "perfect chart."
* Conflict is not a sign of failure; it is the friction necessary for consciousness.
* **The best partner is not the one who validates your ego, but the one who triggers your growth.**

## Conclusion: The Action Plan

### How to Apply This Knowledge
1. **Stop Blaming**: When you have a relationship problem, stop looking at *their* chart. Look at *yours*. What planet of yours is being triggered?
2. **Define Your Anima/Animus**:
 * *For Men*: Look at your Moon/Venus. Describe the "Ideal Woman." That description is actually a description of your own emotional needs.
 * *For Women*: Look at your Sun/Mars. Describe the "Ideal Man." That is a description of your own creative drive.
3. **Withdraw the Projection**: If you attract "weak" partners, ask: "Where am I weak?" If you attract "angry" partners, ask: "Where is my anger?"

### Actionable Exercises

**Exercise: The Projection Audit**
1. List your ex-partners.
2. Find the "Common Denominator" (e.g., They were all emotionally unavailable).
3. Look at your chart. Do you have a hard Saturn-Moon aspect? (Moon = Emotion, Saturn = Unavailable).
4. **Realization**: *You* are the one who is emotionally unavailable (defended). You projected this onto them so you didn't have to feel your own wall.

**Exercise: The Inner Marriage Visualization**
1. Close your eyes. Imagine your Sun (Father) and Moon (Mother) as two people in a room.
2. What are they doing? Are they talking? Fighting? Ignoring each other?
3. Ask them what they need from each other to make peace. This is the work you must do in your own psyche.

### Final Verdict
*Relating* is the most important book you will ever read on relationships, astrological or otherwise. It is a mirror that shows you your own face. It is essential for anyone who wants a relationship based on reality rather than illusion.
