## Introduction: The Roots of the Tree

### The "Black Box" of Astrology
Before the publication of this seminar transcript in 1987, astrological texts often treated the adult personality as a fait accompli. You were "an Aries" or "a Moon-Pluto person," and that was that. *The Development of the Personality* changed the conversation by asking: **How did you get there?**

Liz Greene and Howard Sasportas, the founders of the Centre for Psychological Astrology (CPA) in London, integrated classical astrology with **Developmental Psychology** (Freud, Klein, Erikson, Jung). They argued that the birth chart is not just a description of the adult, but a map of the **developmental stages** the child must negotiate.

### The Dialogue Format
The book captures the magic of a live seminar. It is not a dry textbook; it is a dialogue. You hear the audience's questions, the speakers' humor, and the spontaneous insights that arise when two masters riff on a chart. This format makes complex psychoanalytic concepts accessible and alive.

### Who Is This Book For?
* **The Psychotherapist**: Who wants to use the chart to identify specific points of childhood trauma (fixation points).
* **The Parent**: Who wants to understand their child's unique developmental needs beyond "Sun Sign" clichés.
* **The Adult Child**: Who is still entangled in their parents' unlived life and wants to cut the cord.

## Part I: The Stages of Childhood (Howard Sasportas)

Howard Sasportas opens the series by mapping the standard stages of child development onto the astrological chart.

### 1. The Oral Stage (0-18 months) — The Domain of the Moon
* **Psychological Task**: Establishing basic trust. "Is the world safe?"
* **Astrological Significator**: **The Moon**.
 * The Moon represents the mother (or primary caregiver), the breast, the stomach, and the feeling of containment.
 * **Successful Integration**: If the mother is "good enough" (Winnicott's term), the child internalizes a "Good Moon." They feel safe, fed, and held.
 * **Fixation**: If the bond is disrupted, the adult remains "orally fixated."
* **Chart Indicators**:
 * **Moon-Saturn**: The "Cold Mother." The child felt the mother was dutiful but unfeeling, or absent.
 * *Adult Result*: Fear of intimacy. Emotional self-sufficiency ("I don't need anyone"). Eating disorders (anorexia/control).
 * **Moon-Pluto**: The "Devouring Mother." The mother was intrusive, anxious, or controlling.
 * *Adult Result*: Emotional paranoia. Eating disorders (bulimia/purging). Relationships are seen as life-or-death struggles for survival.
 * **Moon-Neptune**: The "Idealized Mother." The mother was a victim, a saint, or an addict.
 * *Adult Result*: Psychic merging. Hard time distinguishing "my feelings" from "your feelings."

### 2. The Anal Stage (18 months - 3 years) — The Domain of Saturn
* **Psychological Task**: Autonomy vs. Shame. Learning to say "No." Toilet training.
* **Astrological Significator**: **Saturn** (Control/Limits) and **Mars** (Assertion).
* **The Battle**: The child realizes they are separate from the mother. They want to control their own body (bowels).
 * **Successful Integration**: The child learns self-control without shame. They develop a healthy **Ego Boundary**.
 * **Fixation**: If the parent is too strict (Saturn) or shaming, the child becomes obsessive-compulsive (controlling everything to avoid shame) or messy/rebellious.
* **Chart Indicators**:
 * **Mars-Saturn**: The "Blocked Will." The child was punished for asserting themselves.
 * *Adult Result*: Passive-aggression. Difficulty starting projects. "If I try, I will be punished."
 * **Sun-Saturn**: The "Internal Critic." The Father (or authority) was the voice of "No."
 * *Adult Result*: Deep inferiority complex. Over-achievement to prove worth.

### 3. The Oedipal/Phallic Stage (3-6 years) — The Domain of the Sun and Venus
* **Psychological Task**: Gender identity. Romance. Competition.
* **Astrological Significator**: **The Sun** (Identity) and **Venus** (Love/Value).
* **The Triangle**: The child falls in love with the opposite-sex parent and rivals the same-sex parent.
 * *The Goal*: To eventually "lose" the battle, identify with the same-sex parent, and go out into the world to find a partner of one's own.
* **Chart Indicators**:
 * **Venus-Mars**: The erotic drive. How the child expresses affection.
 * **Sun-Venus**: The "Daddy's Girl" or "Mummy's Boy."
 * *The Trap*: If the parent is *too* seductive or close, the child "wins" the Oedipal battle. They become the "Little Husband/Wife."
 * *Adult Result*: They cannot find a partner who measures up to the idealized parent. They are "married" to the parent psychologically.

## Part II: The Parental Marriage (Liz Greene)

Liz Greene takes the stage to discuss one of the most profound concepts in psychological astrology: **The Inner Marriage**.

### 1. The Blueprint of Relationship
Greene argues that we do not enter relationships as blank slates. We carry a blueprint derived from our perception of the bond between our parents.
* **The Significators**: In the birth chart, the **Sun** represents the Father-image, and the **Moon** represents the Mother-image.
* **The Aspect**: The aspect between the Sun and Moon (e.g., Square, Trine) describes the *relationship* between them. This becomes our internal definition of "Marriage."

### 2. Sun-Moon Aspects: The Scripts
* **Sun Conjunct Moon**: The United Front.
 * *Child's View*: The parents were seen as a single unit. There was no space between them.
 * *Adult Consequence*: The person seeks total fusion in relationship. They are self-contained ("I am my own husband and wife"). They may struggle to understand gender differences because the archetypes are blended.
* **Sun Square Moon**: The Civil War.
 * *Child's View*: The parents were at cross-purposes. "If I please Dad, I betray Mum." The atmosphere was tense with unresolvable conflict.
 * *Adult Consequence*: Internal conflict. The head (Sun) fights the heart (Moon). They project this onto partners: "I attract people who fight me." They unconsciously believe that **Love = Conflict**.
 * *The Gift*: If they resolve this, they have tremendous energy and drive. They build a relationship that can handle difference.
* **Sun Opposition Moon**: The Standoff.
 * *Child's View*: The parents were in separate camps. They may have stayed together "for the children," but they lived parallel lives.
 * *Adult Consequence*: The person feels split. They tend to "act out" one planet and "project" the other. (e.g., "I am rational [Sun], my wife is hysterical [Moon]"). They swing between extremes.
* **Sun Trine Moon**: The Harmony.
 * *Child's View*: The parents flowed together. There was ease.
 * *Adult Consequence*: They expect relationships to be easy.
 * *The Trap*: **Complacency**. When the inevitable conflict arises, they give up. "It shouldn't be this hard." They lack the grit of the Square person.

### 3. The Unlived Life of the Parent
Greene introduces a terrifying but liberating concept: **Psychic Inheritance**.
* **The Law**: "The greatest burden on the child is the unlived life of the parent." (Jung).
* **The Mechanism**: If a mother represses her anger (Mars) or her creativity (Sun) to be a "good mother," that energy doesn't disappear. It goes underground and possesses the child.
 * *Example*: The "Good Mother" has a child who screams uncontrollably. The child is acting out the mother's shadow.
* **The Astrological Clue**: Look at the child's Saturn or Pluto. It often hooks into the parent's unlived planet.
* **The Solution**: We must look at our chart to see what belongs to *us* and what is "ancestral baggage." We must give the unlived life back to the parents (symbolically).

## Part III: Subpersonalities (Howard Sasportas)

Sasportas introduces the technique of **Psychosynthesis** (developed by Roberto Assagioli) to astrology.

### 1. The Parliament of Selves
The chart is not one person; it is a committee.
* **The Problem**: We usually identify with *one* part (e.g., the Sun or Ascendant) and repress the others.
* **The Symptom**: The repressed part creates a symptom.
 * *Example*: A person identifies with their disciplined Saturn ("I am a hard worker"). They repress their Jupiter ("I want to party").
 * *Result*: They develop a "binge eating" habit. The Jupiter energy erupts sideways.

### 2. Identifying the Voices
Sasportas teaches how to turn planets into characters.
* **Exercise**: Imagine your Venus (Love) and your Uranus (Freedom) are two people in a room.
 * *Venus in Taurus*: "I want to stay home, cuddle, and be safe."
 * *Uranus in Sagittarius*: "I want to fly to India and never come back."
 * *The Conflict*: If you ignore one, it will sabotage you. (You stay home, but you are restless and mean. Or you travel, but you feel lonely).

### 3. The Board Meeting
The astrological task is to hold a "Board Meeting."
* **The Chairperson**: The Ego (Sun). Its job is not to be a dictator, but a facilitator.
* **The Negotiation**: "Okay, Uranus, we will go to India for 2 weeks. But Venus, we will stay in a nice hotel, not a tent."
* **The Goal**: **Synthesis**. Finding a life structure that allows all the gods to have a voice.

## Part IV: Puer and Senex (Liz Greene)

This seminar is a masterpiece of archetypal psychology. Greene explores the eternal battle between Youth and Age.

### 1. The Puer Aeternus (Eternal Youth)
* **The Archetype**: Peter Pan, Icarus, The Little Prince. The one who flies.
* **Astrological Rulers**: **Uranus**, **Mercury**, **Sun** (in Fire/Air).
* **The Psychology**:
 * *The Desire*: To remain open to all possibilities. "I don't want to choose, because choosing means killing off other options."
 * *The Fear*: Entrapment. Commitment = Death. They hate the word "Forever."
 * *The Shadow*: They never achieve anything real because achievement requires time, limit, and repetition (Saturn). They have brilliant ideas but no product.
* **The "Mother-Bound" Puer**: Greene notes that the Puer is often psychologically married to the mother (or the realm of the unconscious). He refuses to enter the father's world of responsibility.

### 2. The Senex (The Old Man)
* **The Archetype**: Kronos, The King, The Hermit. The one who builds.
* **Astrological Ruler**: **Saturn** (and Earth signs).
* **The Psychology**:
 * *The Desire*: Order, structure, endurance, legacy.
 * *The Fear*: Chaos, change, irrationality.
 * *The Shadow*: Depression, cynicism, rigidity. He crushes the life out of new things because they are "risky."

### 3. The Secret Identity
Greene reveals the punchline: **Puer and Senex are two faces of the same coin.**
* **The Split**: We usually identify with one and project the other.
 * *The Puer Life*: The person acts young and irresponsible. But fate forces them into a "Senex" situation (e.g., they get a girl pregnant, or get a boring job to pay debt). They feel imprisoned.
 * *The Senex Life*: The person acts old and responsible. But they secretly envy the freedom of the Puer. They may have a sudden "mid-life crisis" (Puer eruption) and run away with a 20-year-old.
* **The Integration**: The goal is to be the **"Wise Child"** or the **"Youthful Elder"**.
 * *How*: To keep the spark of potential (Puer) but build a container for it (Saturn). To fly (Uranus) but carry a map (Saturn).

## ⚖️ Part V: Critical Analysis and Conclusion

### 1. Strengths: The "Why" Factor
* **Depth**: This book explains *why* we have certain complexes. It traces the intensity of a Pluto aspect back to the pre-verbal bond with the mother. It removes the "shame" of having a difficult chart.
* **The Compassion**: Despite the heavy topics, the tone is deeply compassionate. Greene and Sasportas emphasize that *everyone* is wounded in the developmental process; it is the price of incarnation.

### 2. Limitations
* **Psychoanalytic Bias**: The book relies heavily on Freud and Klein. Readers who dislike the "blame the mother" tendency of early psychoanalysis might find some sections repetitive.
* **Not a Cookbook**: Because it is a transcript, it wanders. You cannot just look up "Sun in Aries." You have to read the whole seminar to understand the *principle* of the Sun.

## Summary and Distillation

### 1. One-Sentence Core Insight
> **"We do not enter relationships or adulthood as blank slates; we carry the internal marriage of our parents and the unresolved needs of our inner child, and until we integrate these archetypes, we are doomed to re-enact their drama."**

### 2. Classic Quotes (Selected & Contextualized)

> **【Quote 1】**
> "The chart is a map of the psyche, and the psyche is a structure that develops in time. The chart does not change, but the way we inhabit it does."
> *— Introduction*
> **Interpretation**: Astrology is developmental. A 5-year-old's Saturn is different from a 50-year-old's Saturn.

> **【Quote 2】**
> "The Puer wants to fly; the Senex wants to build. Life requires both."
> *— Part IV: Puer and Senex*
> **Interpretation**: The necessity of balancing vision (Uranus) with work (Saturn).

> **【Quote 3】**
> "You cannot get rid of a subpersonality. You can only educate it."
> *— Part III: Subpersonalities*
> **Interpretation**: Repression doesn't work. Negotiation is the only path to inner peace.

## Conclusion: The Action Plan

### How to Use This Book
1. **Analyze Your Moon**: Read Part I. Ask: "Did I feel safe as a baby?" Look at your Moon sign and aspects. This is your "inner infant."
2. **Analyze Your Sun-Moon Aspect**: Read Part II. Draw a picture of your father (Sun) and mother (Moon). How do they relate in the drawing? That is your relationship blueprint.
3. **Identify the Puer/Senex**: Where are you avoiding commitment (Puer)? Where are you too rigid (Senex)?

### Actionable Exercises

**Exercise: The Board Meeting**
1. Identify a conflict in your life (e.g., "I want to quit my job [Uranus], but I need money [Saturn]").
2. Write a dialogue between them.
3. **Uranus**: "I'm bored! I'm dying here!"
4. **Saturn**: "We have a mortgage. Don't be stupid."
5. **The Ego (Chairperson)**: "Okay, we won't quit today. But we will start a night class to learn a new skill. Saturn pays for it, Uranus picks the topic."

**Exercise: The Parental Audit**
1. List 3 traits of your Father. List 3 traits of your Mother.
2. Look at your partner. How many of these traits do they have?
3. **Realization**: You married your parents. Now, separate the past from the present.

### Final Verdict
*The Development of the Personality* is a foundational text for **Psychological Astrology**. It takes the "fortune-telling" out of the chart and replaces it with a rigorous map of the soul's growth. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the *roots* of their personality.
