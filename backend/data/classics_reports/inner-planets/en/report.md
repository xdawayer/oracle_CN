## Introduction: The Foundation of the Ego

### The "Forgotten" Planets
In psychological astrology, there is often a tendency to obsess over the "heavy hitters"—Saturn (Karma), Pluto (Transformation), and Chiron (Wounding). The inner planets (**Mercury, Venus, Mars**) are frequently dismissed as "lightweight" or purely functional. They are seen as the "servants" of the chart, not the masters.

*The Inner Planets* corrects this imbalance. Liz Greene and Howard Sasportas argue that without a healthy Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the Ego has no legs to stand on. You cannot undergo a Plutonian transformation if you don't have a healthy Mars to survive it. You cannot integrate Neptunian spirituality if you don't have a grounded Venus to value it. These planets are the **Building Blocks of Personal Reality**. They are the tools we use to navigate daily life.

### The Mythic Dimension
As always with the CPA seminars, the planets are treated not just as functions, but as **gods**.
* **Mercury is Hermes**: The Magician, the Thief, the Guide of Souls.
* **Venus is Aphrodite**: The Golden One, the goddess of Choice and Values.
* **Mars is Ares**: The Warrior, the survival instinct, the immune system.
By understanding the myths, we understand the compulsions that drive our daily behavior.

### Who Is This Book For?
* **The "Spiritual" Bypass Victim**: Who tries to transcend the ego without having built one first. (You need a strong Mars/Sun to have an ego to transcend).
* **The Writer/Communicator**: Who wants to understand the deeper alchemy of Mercury beyond just "intellect."
* **The Person with Relationship Issues**: Who needs to understand the Venus-Mars dynamic within themselves before looking for it in a partner.

## ☿ Part I: Mercury — The Weaver of Worlds (Liz Greene)

Liz Greene opens the seminar with a brilliant exploration of the Trickster God.

### 1. The Archetype of Hermes
Hermes (Mercury) is the only god who can travel freely between all three worlds:
1. **Olympus (Spirit)**: The realm of the gods/ideals.
2. **Earth (Reality)**: The realm of daily life.
3. **Hades (Unconscious)**: The realm of the dead/soul.
* **The Psychological Function**: Mercury is the bridge. He translates the "ineffable" (Neptune) into words. He brings the "darkness" (Pluto) into the light. Without Mercury, the psyche is fragmented. He connects the dots.

### 2. The Trickster and the Thief
Mercury is amoral. He steals Apollo's cattle on the day he is born. He lies.
* **The Value of Lying**: Greene argues that a healthy mind *must* be able to lie. Why? Because the ability to lie means the ability to imagine something that is not currently present (Fiction, Planning, Hypothesis). A mind that can only tell the truth is rigid (Saturnian).
* **Flexibility**: Mercury allows us to adapt. He is the "Artful Dodger." We need this energy to navigate the paradoxes of life.

### 3. Sibling Dynamics: Cain and Abel
Greene connects Mercury to the **Sibling Archetype**. Our first experience of "peers" happens with siblings.
* **The Shadow**: Siblings are often the first recipients of our shadow projection. "I am the good one; he is the bad one." Or "She is the smart one; I am the dumb one."
* **Mercury Problems**: Hard aspects to Mercury often indicate deep sibling wounds. The person feels "stupid" or "unheard" because of a dominant brother/sister.
* **Healing**: Reclaiming the voice. Realizing that intelligence has many forms.

### 4. Mercury in the Elements
* **Mercury in Fire**: Intuitive thought. Thinks in flashes/images. Impatient with details. Inspiring speaker.
* **Mercury in Earth**: Practical thought. Thinks in steps/facts. "Show me the evidence." Slow but thorough.
* **Mercury in Air**: Abstract thought. Thinks in concepts/patterns. Loves debate. Detached from feelings.
* **Mercury in Water**: Emotional thought. Thinks in feelings/memories. "I feel like this is true." Photogenic memory for mood.

### 5. The Nervous System
Mercury rules the nerves.
* **Anxiety**: A "bad transit" to Mercury is often experienced as anxiety. The system is overloaded with data. The "wires" are fraying.
* **The Cure**: Mercury needs movement (short trips), dexterity (using hands), and conversation to discharge energy.

## ♀️ Part II: Venus — The Goddess of Value (Howard Sasportas)

Howard Sasportas takes the lead on Venus, moving far beyond the cliché of "love and beauty."

### 1. The Psychology of Worth
Sasportas argues that Venus is primarily about **Self-Worth**.
* **The Equation**: We attract what we believe we are worth.
 * *Venus-Saturn*: "I am not worth much." -> Attracts stingy, cold, or demanding partners. Or stays in a job that underpays them.
 * *Venus-Jupiter*: "I am worth a lot." -> Attracts generous partners (or becomes arrogant).
* **The Mirror**: Look at your bank account and your partner. They are mirrors of your internal Venus. If you want to change them, change your self-valuation.

### 2. The Judgement of Paris
In the myth, Paris had to choose between Hera (Power), Athena (Victory/Wisdom), and Aphrodite (Beauty/Pleasure). He chose Aphrodite.
* **The Meaning**: Life forces us to choose. Every choice implies a sacrifice. Venus is the function that decides *what matters most* to us.
* **Values Conflict**: If your Venus is in Capricorn (Values status) but your Sun is in Aquarius (Values equality), you will feel torn. You might date a rich banker (Venus) but feel like a sellout (Sun).

### 3. The Erotic Principle
Venus represents **Eros**—not just sex, but the principle of *connection* and *relatedness*.
* **The Glue**: Mars separates; Venus connects. Without Venus, we are isolated monads.
* **The Shadow of Venus**:
 * **Vanity**: Obsession with appearance to hide inner emptiness.
 * **Jealousy**: The fear that "someone else has what I need."
 * **The Golden Cage**: Staying in a bad situation because it is comfortable/financially secure (Taurus side of Venus).

## ♂️ Part III: Mars — The Will to Survive (Liz Greene)

Liz Greene returns to discuss Mars, linking it to the biological will to live.

### 1. The Necessity of Aggression
Greene attacks the "new age" notion that anger is bad or "unspiritual."
* **The Immune System**: Mars is the psychological immune system. It attacks invaders (criticism, abuse, viruses). If you suppress Mars ("turning the other cheek" compulsively), you have no defense.
* **Depression**: Greene famously states, **"Depression is often anger turned inward."** When Mars cannot go out (aggression), it goes in (self-attack/inflammation).
 * *Mechanism*: You get angry at your boss. You can't yell. You swallow it. Two days later, you have a migraine or a sudden drop in energy. That is Mars attacking you.

### 2. Mars and Separation
* **Birth**: Birth is a Martian act. The baby must fight its way out of the womb.
* **Individuation**: To be an individual, you must say "No" to the collective. "No" is a Martian word. "Yes" is Venusian.
* **Mars-Saturn**: The "Blocked Will." The car with the handbrake on. This creates immense internal heat (frustration) which can lead to cruelty or incredible endurance.

### 3. The Myth of Ares
Ares was not liked by the other gods (except Aphrodite). He was crude, violent, and physical.
* **The Lesson**: We must honor our "inner brute." If we try to be too civilized (Apollo) or too loving (Venus) without Mars, we become impotent and resentful.
* **The Healthy Mars**: Assertiveness. Going after what you want directly. Competition. Sexual passion.

## Part IV: Synthesis — The Ego Triangle

The book culminates in the understanding that Mercury, Venus, and Mars form the **Triad of Personality**. They are the executives of the Ego (Sun).

### 1. The Interaction Flow
In any decision, these three must cooperate:
1. **Mercury**: Perceives the options and gathers data. ("There is a job opening in Paris.")
2. **Venus**: Evaluates the options based on value. ("I would love Paris; it is beautiful.")
3. **Mars**: Acts on the choice. ("I will apply for the job and pack my bags.")

### 2. Dysfunction: When the Team Fails
* **Mercury-Mars Conflict (e.g., Square)**: "Act first, think later." Impulsiveness. Or "Think, but never act."
* **Venus-Mars Conflict (e.g., Square)**: "I want what is bad for me." Or "I love you, but I want to hurt you." The war between peace and passion.
* **Mercury-Venus Conflict**: "My head disagrees with my heart." Logic vs. Value.

### 3. Case Studies
* **Case 1: The Artist**: High Venus/Mercury connection. They can communicate (Mercury) beauty (Venus). But if Mars is weak, they never finish the painting.
* **Case 2: The Activist**: High Mars/Mercury connection. They fight (Mars) with words (Mercury). But if Venus is weak, they may become strident and lose public support.

## ⚖️ Part V: Critical Analysis and Conclusion

### 1. Strengths: Grounding the Woo-Woo
* **Practicality**: This is one of the most practical books in the series. It deals with daily life: talking, loving, fighting. It brings astrology down from the clouds.
* **Humor**: The interplay between Greene and Sasportas is witty and warm. They make the gods feel human.

### 2. Limitations
* **Less "Glamorous"**: Because it deals with the "basics," it lacks the transformative punch of *Pluto* or the deep sorrow of *Chiron*. It is "maintenance" work, not "demolition" work. Some students might find it less exciting.
* **Seminar Style**: As always, the transcript format can be rambling.

## Conclusion: The Action Plan

### How to Use This Book
1. **Check Your Mercury**: How do you learn? (Visual? Auditory?). Honor that style. Don't try to be a "Saturn" learner if you are a "Mercury-Uranus" learner.
2. **Check Your Mars**: Are you depressed? If so, find a safe outlet for aggression (Kickboxing, shouting in a pillow, competitive sports). You need to "heat up."
3. **Check Your Venus**: What brings you pleasure? Schedule it. Pleasure is not a luxury; it is Venusian food. If you starve Venus, you become bitter.

### Actionable Exercises

**Exercise: The Mars Reclamation**
1. Think of a time you were angry but swallowed it.
2. What did you want to say? Write it down now (uncensored).
3. **Visualisation**: Imagine saying it. Feel the heat in your body. Own the power. (You don't have to actually say it to the person; you just have to *own* the impulse).

**Exercise: The Venus Date**
1. Take yourself on a date.
2. Do exactly what *you* value (not what is "cool" or "productive").
3. **Notice**: Do you feel guilty? That guilt is the enemy of Venus.

### Final Verdict
*The Inner Planets* is the owner's manual for your personality. It teaches you how to drive the car of your life. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to be functional, effective, and happy in the real world.
